    <h2>This Site</h2>
    <p>
      This site is an ongoing exercise in learning to program for pages and
      applications for the web. If you know your way around web development,
      you won't learn much here, but I sure will. That, after all, is the point.

    <h2>Why I'm building it</h2>
    <p>
      The work I'm doing here is bounded, for now, by the need to meet course
      requirements for Northern Arizona University's CS212: Web Programming.
      In the future, this site may serve as a jumping-off point for a personal
      portfolio site. Knowing me, it's just as likely that it will lay conceptual
      groundwork for an entirely new build. Sometimes it's easier to start fresh
      than refactor old work.

    <h2>Things I hope to learn about re: web programming</h2>
    <p>
      As a very young front-end developer, I'm getting plenty of mileage out of
      writing raw html and CSS. That said, I plan to use available tools to
      take some of the redundancey out of my markup, and some of the pain out
      of the inevitable re-styling I'll have to do.
